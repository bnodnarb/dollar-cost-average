## What is dollar-cost-average?
dollar-cost-average is a self-hosted ruby app that allows users to invest in an index of cryptocurrencies.

The app works by enabling users to programmatically distribute a stablecoin of their choosing into a basket of cryptocurrencies weighted by market capitalization.

For example, Alice wants to invest $1,000 per month into an index of cryptocurrencies. Each month, Alice converts US$ 1,000 into USDC, and uses the dollar-cost-average app to distribute that USDC into each of the top 50 cryptocurrencies. Each month, Alice gains exposure to a wide range of cryptocurrencies with minimal effort.
